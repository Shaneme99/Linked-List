/*
Linked List implementation by Shane Menzigian
Started on 5/23/23
Description: A linked list contains nodes, each one pointing to another node. Combined, they somewhat follow a list.
The linked list's head is the first item in the list, which then points to the next node, which points to the next, and so on.
This program has methods for adding and deleting the first node, searching for the first instance of specific values, and adding and deleting a node at the end of the chain.
